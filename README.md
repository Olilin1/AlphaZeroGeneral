# Yet another AlphaZero general (now with even more generalizations!!!!!)

Yes yes, I know. There are already like 100 different AlphaZero general repositories, what makes this one different? You see this one, just like alphazero-general, allows for multiple players. However, this implementation allows player order to be arbitrary. Want player 3 to go after player 1? Go ahead! Want player 1 to take two actions in a row if the moon is in its third phase? You can do that!

No but seriously, this repo was made for learning and personal reasons, if you want something actually usable go check out some of the following repositories:

https://github.com/kevaday/alphazero-general

https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general

https://github.com/bhansconnect/fast-alphazero-general
